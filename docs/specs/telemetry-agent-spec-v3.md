# Telemetry Agent Specification

**Status:** Draft v3.2
**Created:** 2026-02-05
**Updated:** 2026-02-21
**Purpose:** AI agent that auto-instruments TypeScript code with OpenTelemetry based on a Weaver schema

## Revision History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| v1 | 2026-02-05 | Initial draft |
| v2 | 2026-02-06 | Incorporated consolidated technical review (Michael Rishi Forrester + Claude). Resolved Q5 (framework choice). Added research spikes, file revert protocol, Coordinator-managed SDK writes, dependency installation workflow, variable shadowing checks, periodic schema checkpoints, configurable limits, in-memory results, span density guardrails, and fix loop ceilings. |
| v3 | 2026-02-07 | **Instrumentation model:** Replaced hardcoded span caps with priority-based hierarchy and review sensitivity. Restored rich LibraryRequirement objects. Added cost visibility. **Interfaces:** Moved CLI and GitHub Action to PoC scope. Added Coordinator programmatic API with progress callbacks. **Execution:** Added dry run mode, exclude patterns, config validation (Zod). **Result enrichment:** Added per-file agent notes, schema hash tracking, agent version tagging. **Spec hygiene:** Moved testCommand env note to Configuration. Added technical explanation for uncovered async patterns. Added RS2 (Weaver Integration Approach) and renumbered fix loop design to RS3; replaced "start with CLI" implementation-time decision with research spike. |
| v3.1 | 2026-02-16 | **Cost visibility:** Redesigned pre-run cost from post-hoc PR-only to configurable pre-run confirmation step. Renamed from "estimate" to "ceiling" — without historical data, these are ceilings not estimates. Simplified `CostCeiling` cost metric to single `maxTokensCeiling` field (retains `fileCount` and `totalFileSizeBytes` for context; tighter ceilings are future work). Added `onCostCeilingReady` callback, `confirmEstimate` config option (CLI only), CLI `--yes`/`-y` flag, exit code 3 (user abort), and dry run prompt guidance. **MCP:** Added `get-cost-ceiling` tool to handle confirmation at the tool boundary (MCP tools are request-response, can't pause mid-call). Token usage estimation and tighter ceilings added to Out of Scope (Future). Ceiling still appears in PR summary alongside actuals. **Correctness:** Added explicit schema re-resolution between files (agents must see prior agents' extensions). Clarified checkpoint failure behavior: stop processing but still create PR with partial results. Added dry run skips periodic checkpoints. **Precision:** Specified `maxTokensPerFile` enforcement mechanism (Coordinator sums API response metadata). Added schema hash canonicalization requirement. Added squash merge guidance for per-file commits. |
| v3.2 | 2026-02-21 | **Dependency strategy:** Added `dependencyStrategy` config field (set during init). Services use `dependencies`; distributable packages use `peerDependencies`. `@opentelemetry/api` is always a peerDependency per OTel JS contrib GUIDELINES.md — multiple instances cause silent trace loss. Init phase now detects project type and records the strategy. Coordinator respects strategy during bulk install. |

## Vision

An AI agent that takes a Weaver schema and code files, then automatically instruments them with OpenTelemetry. The agent prioritizes semantic conventions, can extend the schema as needed, and validates its work through Weaver.

**Short-term goal:** Works on commit-story-v2 repository
**Long-term goal:** Distributable tool that works on any TypeScript codebase

### Why Schema-Driven?

**The gap:** No existing tool combines Weaver schema + AI + source transformation.

Tools like o11y.ai already do AI + TypeScript + PR generation. OllyGarden's tooling (Insights for instrumentation scoring, Tulip for OTel Collector distribution) is adding agentic instrumentation capabilities. But none of them validate against a schema contract. The difference is **"AI guesses what to instrument"** vs **"AI implements a contract that Weaver can verify."**

That verification loop is what makes this approach trustworthy enough to run autonomously. The schema defines the contract, the agent implements it, and Weaver validates the result. Without schema-driven validation, you're trusting AI judgment alone.

---

## Pre-Implementation Research Spikes

Before implementation begins, three research spikes are required. These are timeboxed investigations whose output is documentation, not code. The implementing agent must complete these before writing any agent logic.

### RS1: Prompt Engineering for Code Transformation

**Goal:** Understand what makes LLM prompts reliable for source code modification — not just generation, but transformation of existing code while preserving semantics.

**Deliverable:** A document covering:
- What prompt structures produce correct code transformations (examples, output format constraints, chain-of-thought vs. direct output)
- Common failure modes when LLMs modify existing code (lost context, incomplete edits, hallucinated imports)
- How to structure the "instrumented file" output so it's complete and unambiguous
- Whether the agent should output a full file replacement or a diff/patch
- Findings from any published research or practitioner experience on LLM-based code transformation

**Scope:** Focus on TypeScript instrumentation specifically. Evaluate against the patterns in this spec (wrapping functions with spans, adding imports, try/catch/finally blocks).

### RS2: Weaver Integration Capabilities

**Goal:** Map the capabilities, constraints, and integration characteristics of Weaver CLI and the Weaver MCP server. This spike produces a capability matrix that RS3 consumes when designing the validation loop — it does not make an integration recommendation. The integration decision belongs in RS3, where the actual validation needs are understood.

**Deliverable:** A document covering:
- Capability comparison: what each approach can and can't do (notably: the MCP server provides fuzzy search with relevance scoring that has no CLI equivalent, and ad-hoc `live_check` that accepts JSON samples per call rather than requiring an OTLP stream)
- Architectural implications: the Coordinator would need to maintain an MCP client connection to Weaver alongside its own MCP server for Claude Code — evaluate whether this adds meaningful complexity or is straightforward
- Performance characteristics: the MCP server resolves the registry once into memory with indexed data structures; the CLI re-loads and re-resolves on every call. Quantify the impact for a typical run (periodic checkpoints, per-file fix loops with up to 3 retries each, 50-file runs)
- What the MCP server's ad-hoc `live_check` (per-call JSON sample validation) makes possible — document its capabilities so RS3 can evaluate whether per-file runtime validation changes the fix loop structure
- Whether fuzzy search improves the agent's ability to discover semconv attributes during the attribute priority chain (step 1: check OTel semantic conventions)
- Whether `weaver registry diff --baseline-registry` accepts the output of `weaver registry resolve` as its baseline input, or requires a copy of the source registry directory. This affects the Coordinator's snapshot strategy for periodic checkpoints, dry run output, and PR summary generation — all three features depend on this command.

**Context:** Weaver v0.21.2 introduced `weaver registry mcp` — an MCP server that imports Weaver's internal Rust crates directly, loads and resolves the entire registry into memory once at startup, and serves 7 tools: `search` (fuzzy text search with relevance scoring), `get_attribute`, `get_metric`, `get_span`, `get_event`, `get_entity` (O(1) lookups from in-memory indexes), and `live_check` (validates telemetry samples against the registry through Weaver's full advisor pipeline). Weaver v0.21.2 also added `weaver serve` (REST API + web UI) which could help during development/debugging.

**Scope:** Focus on PoC needs. Document what's available without bias toward any particular integration approach — the findings should stand on their own so RS3 can make an informed design decision.

### RS3: Validation/Fix Loop Design

**Goal:** Understand how existing AI coding tools handle the "generate → validate → fix → retry" cycle, design the fix loop mechanics for this agent, and determine the Weaver integration approach based on what the fix loop actually needs.

**Deliverable:** A document covering:
- How tools like Cursor, Aider, Claude Code, and similar handle iterative code correction
- What context to include in fix-loop prompts (full file? just the error? original + current?)
- How to prevent the agent from oscillating between different broken states
- Recommended max retry counts and when to bail out
- How to combine multi-turn conversations and fresh API calls within the fix loop (not either/or — evaluate when preserving context helps vs when resetting prevents oscillation)
- Concrete fix loop design recommendation for this agent
- Based on the fix loop design and the RS2 capability matrix, determine which Weaver integration points the validation loop needs — this produces the Weaver integration recommendation (CLI, MCP, or both) grounded in actual validation requirements

**Implementation-time decision:** The fix loop is not a binary choice between multi-turn conversations and separate API calls — it's a question of when to use each. Multi-turn preserves what the agent tried (valuable for iterating on a specific error), while fresh calls prevent context bloat and oscillation (valuable when the agent is stuck). RS3 should evaluate hybrid strategies: e.g., multi-turn within a validation stage, fresh calls between stages; or multi-turn for the first N retries, then reset to a fresh call if the agent is oscillating.

**Scope:** Focus on the per-file validation chain (syntax → lint → Weaver). The end-of-run validation is separate and doesn't involve fix loops.

## Architecture

### Coordinator + Agents Architecture

The system has a **Coordinator** (deterministic script) that manages workflow and delegates to **AI Agents** for the parts that need intelligence.

#### Coordinator (Not AI)
- **What it is:** A deterministic TypeScript script using Node.js
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Branch management (create feature branch)
  - File iteration (glob for files to process, apply exclude patterns)
  - **File snapshots** before handing to agent (for revert on failure)
  - Spawn AI agent instances
  - Collect results from each agent (in-memory)
  - **Periodic schema checkpoints** (Weaver validation every N files)
  - **Aggregate library requirements** from all agents and perform single SDK init file write
  - **Bulk dependency installation** (`npm install` for all discovered libraries, respecting `dependencyStrategy` for package.json placement)
  - Run end-of-run validation (Weaver live-check)
  - Assemble PR with summary (including per-file span category breakdown, review sensitivity annotations, agent notes, and token usage data)
- **Why not AI:** These are mechanical tasks that don't need intelligence

#### Schema Builder Agent (Future — Not in PoC)
- **Purpose:** Discover codebase structure, auto-generate Weaver schema
- **Status:** Descoped from PoC — "detecting service boundaries" and "mapping directories to spans" is too ambiguous
- **PoC approach:** Schema must already exist. User or Claude Code creates it manually.
- **Future:** Research how to automatically map directory structure to span patterns

#### Instrumentation Agent (Per-File)
- **Purpose:** Instrument a single file according to existing schema
- **Runs:** Fresh instance per file (prevents laziness)
- **Allowed to:** Read schema + single file, extend schema within guardrails
- **Not allowed to:** Scan codebase, restructure existing schema definitions, modify the SDK init file, run `npm install`
- **Outputs:** In-memory result object returned to Coordinator (see Result Data)

**What "fresh instance" means:** A new LLM API call with a clean context. The context contains only: the system prompt, the resolved Weaver schema, the single file to instrument, and trace context (trace ID + parent span ID for observability). No conversation history, result data, or context from previous files carries over. This is the key mechanism that prevents quality degradation across files — each file gets the agent's full attention as if it were the only file. (Trace context is operational metadata, not task context — it doesn't undermine the quality argument.)

**Schema re-resolution:** The Coordinator re-resolves the Weaver schema (`weaver registry resolve`) before each file, not once at startup. Since agents can extend the schema and their changes are committed to the feature branch after each successful file (step 4e), subsequent agents must see those extensions to avoid creating duplicate attributes or conflicting span IDs. The performance cost is real (resolution involves fetching and resolving the semconv dependency), but correctness requires it.

This separation solves the "scope problem": discovery happens once in init, instrumentation follows established patterns. The Coordinator handles the mechanical orchestration.

### Coordinator Programmatic API

**Architectural constraint:** The Coordinator exposes a programmatic API (a function that accepts a typed config object and returns a typed result). All interface layers (MCP server, CLI, GitHub Action) construct the config object from their respective inputs and call the same Coordinator function. No interface-specific logic lives in the Coordinator.

#### Progress Callbacks

The Coordinator accepts an optional `callbacks` object for progress reporting:

```typescript
interface CostCeiling {
  fileCount: number;
  totalFileSizeBytes: number;
  maxTokensCeiling: number;          // fileCount * maxTokensPerFile (theoretical worst case)
}

interface CoordinatorCallbacks {
  onCostCeilingReady?: (ceiling: CostCeiling) => boolean | void;
  onFileStart?: (path: string, index: number, total: number) => void;
  onFileComplete?: (result: FileResult, index: number, total: number) => void;
  onSchemaCheckpoint?: (filesProcessed: number, passed: boolean) => boolean | void;
  onValidationStart?: () => void;
  onValidationComplete?: (passed: boolean, complianceReport: string) => void;
  onRunComplete?: (results: FileResult[]) => void;
}
```

The `onCostCeilingReady` callback fires after file globbing but before any agent processing begins, **only when `confirmEstimate` is `true`**. When `confirmEstimate` is `false`, the Coordinator still calculates the ceiling internally (for the PR summary) but does not invoke the callback. If the callback returns `false`, the Coordinator aborts the run. Returning `true` or `void` (or not providing the callback) proceeds normally.

Each interface layer wires these to its own output mechanism: the CLI prints progress lines to stderr, the MCP server sends structured progress events, and the GitHub Action uses `core.info()` step annotations. The Coordinator itself never writes to stdout/stderr directly — all user-facing output flows through callbacks or the final result object. This keeps the Coordinator testable and interface-agnostic.

### Coordinator Error Handling

The Coordinator classifies errors into three categories based on whether subsequent work would be valid and useful. The PR summary is the single place where all warnings and degradations are reported.

**Abort immediately** (unrecoverable — subsequent work would be invalid or wasted):

| Error | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Config validation failure | Nothing can run with bad config |
| Can't create feature branch (git error) | No place to commit results |
| Invalid or missing API key | Agent calls will all fail |
| Weaver binary not found | No schema validation possible |
| Schema validation fails during startup (before any files processed) | Starting schema is broken; agent extensions will compound the problem |

**Degrade and continue** (isolated failure — the run can still produce useful output):

| Error | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Individual npm package fails to install during bulk install | Skip it, warn in PR summary |
| Weaver live-check port already in use at end-of-run | Skip live-check, warn in PR summary |
| Git commit fails for a single file | Treat as file-level failure, revert file, continue |

**Degrade and warn** (non-blocking — output is complete but a validation step was skipped):

| Error | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Test suite not found | Skip end-of-run test validation, note in PR summary |
| `weaver registry diff` fails | Omit diff from PR summary, note the omission |

The principle: if the error means subsequent work will be invalid or wasted, abort. If the error is isolated and the run can still produce useful output, degrade and continue. If a non-essential validation or reporting step fails, warn and proceed.

### Interfaces

- **MCP server** (PoC) — invoked from Claude Code
- **CLI** (PoC) — `telemetry-agent instrument src/`
- **GitHub Action** (PoC) — runs on workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)

**Call chains:** Claude Code invokes MCP server tools → MCP server wraps the Coordinator → Coordinator runs the deterministic workflow (branch, file iteration, validation, PR) and spawns fresh Instrumentation Agent instances for each file. The MCP server is a thin interface layer; the Coordinator is where the orchestration logic lives. The CLI and GitHub Action follow the same pattern: parse their respective inputs into a Coordinator config object, call the Coordinator function, and format the result for their output channel.

#### MCP Server

The MCP server exposes two tools for the instrumentation workflow:

- **`get-cost-ceiling`** — Takes the same path and config as `instrument`. Runs file globbing and calculates the cost ceiling (no LLM calls, no git operations). Returns a `CostCeiling` object. This is cheap and fast.
- **`instrument`** — Runs the full instrumentation workflow. The MCP server calls the Coordinator with `confirmEstimate: false` since the confirmation happens at the tool boundary, not inside the Coordinator.

MCP tools are request-response — there's no way to pause mid-tool-call for user input. The two-tool split moves the confirmation step to where MCP can handle it: between tool calls. Claude Code naturally chains tool calls based on responses, so the expected flow is: call `get-cost-ceiling`, present results to user, user confirms, call `instrument`. The tool description for `instrument` should guide Claude Code to call `get-cost-ceiling` first.

This means the `confirmEstimate` config option is effectively irrelevant for the MCP interface — the MCP server always passes `false` to the Coordinator and handles the confirmation flow through its own tool boundary. This is consistent with the principle that each interface layer handles its own UX.

#### CLI

A thin wrapper that parses command-line arguments into a Coordinator config object. Uses `yargs` or manual `process.argv` parsing. Supports `--dry-run`, `--output json` (dumps raw result array for piping), `--yes`/`-y` (skip cost ceiling confirmation), and `--verbose`/`--debug` flags. When `confirmEstimate` is enabled and `--yes` is not passed, the CLI prints the cost ceiling to stderr and prompts "Proceed? [y/N]". In dry run mode, the prompt should communicate that tokens are still consumed even though no persistent changes are made. Exit codes: 0 = all files succeeded, 1 = partial success (some files failed), 2 = total failure, 3 = aborted by user (declined cost ceiling). The CLI is the reference interface for testing and scripting.

#### GitHub Action

An `action.yml` that runs the CLI in a GitHub Actions runner. Setup steps: `actions/setup-node@v4`, npm install, install Weaver CLI. Uses `${{ github.token }}` for PR creation (no additional auth configuration needed). Default trigger: `workflow_dispatch` (manual). Future triggers (on push, on PR) are configuration, not code changes. The Action passes `--yes` to the CLI (non-interactive — no confirmation prompt) but logs the cost ceiling via `core.info()` for workflow visibility. The Action posts the PR summary as a step output and optionally as a PR comment.

### Technology Stack (PoC)

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Coordinator | Plain TypeScript (Node.js) | Deterministic orchestration doesn't need a framework |
| Instrumentation Agent | Direct Anthropic API via `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | Single provider, maximum control, simplest debugging |
| AST manipulation | ts-morph | TypeScript-native, full type access, scope analysis |
| Schema validation | Weaver CLI (with awareness of Weaver MCP server in v0.21.2) | Deterministic validation decoupled from MCP integration during PoC |
| Code formatting | Prettier | Post-transformation formatting |
| MCP interface | MCP TypeScript SDK | Thin wrapper over Coordinator |

**Why direct Anthropic SDK over LangChain/LangGraph:** The agent architecture is simple — the Coordinator is a linear loop, and each Instrumentation Agent is one (or a few) LLM API calls per file. There is no complex state graph, no multi-turn tool-use chains, no branching decision trees. LangGraph solves problems (state machines, checkpointing, complex agent graphs) that this architecture deliberately avoids. The direct SDK provides full control over prompts and API calls with no abstraction overhead, which is critical during prompt iteration. If future complexity demands it (parallel agents with shared state, complex multi-step tool use), migrating to LangGraph is a straightforward refactor — the Coordinator becomes a graph, agent calls become nodes.

**Why not Vercel AI SDK:** Provider-agnostic abstraction adds a layer with no benefit when using a single provider (Claude). The direct Anthropic SDK gives the most transparent debugging experience.

**Note on Weaver MCP server:** Weaver v0.21.2 introduced `weaver registry mcp` — an MCP server providing search, get, and live-check tools directly. Since the PoC architecture already uses MCP (Claude Code → MCP server → Coordinator), the agent could interact with Weaver's native MCP server for schema operations instead of shelling out to CLI commands. Weaver v0.21.2 also added `weaver serve` (REST API + web UI) which could help during development/debugging.

**Weaver integration approach:** Determined by the RS2 + RS3 research spikes. RS2 maps the capabilities of both the CLI (`weaver registry check`, `weaver registry resolve`, `weaver registry diff`) and the MCP server (`weaver registry mcp`, providing in-memory resolution, fuzzy search, and per-call live validation). RS3 then determines which integration points the validation loop needs, producing the final integration recommendation grounded in actual requirements.

## Init Phase (Required)

Before instrumentation can begin, user must run `telemetry-agent init`. This is mandatory.

### What Init Does

1. **Verify prerequisites**
   - `package.json` exists → extracts project name for namespace
   - `@opentelemetry/api` in `peerDependencies` (or offers to add it — always as peerDependency, never direct)
   - OTel SDK initialization exists somewhere → **records path in config** (e.g., `src/telemetry/setup.ts`)
   - OTLP endpoint configured
   - Test suite exists (warns if missing, continues anyway)
   - Verify localhost port availability for Weaver live-check (:4317 gRPC, :4320 HTTP). Note: if running in Docker, ensure the container can bind to these ports.
   - **Implementation-time note:** If ports 4317/4320 are already in use (e.g., local OTel Collector, another Weaver instance), init should detect this and fail with a clear message directing the user to free the ports. Recovery strategies (process detection, reuse, force-clean flags) are implementation decisions. Consider whether to support configurable ports (Weaver may not support this — verify) or require the user to free the ports.

2. **Validate Weaver schema**
   - Schema must already exist (PoC requirement)
   - Run `weaver registry check` to validate
   - If invalid or missing → fail with helpful error

3. **Detect project type** for dependency strategy
   - Check `package.json` for signals: `bin` field (CLI tool), `main`/`exports` fields (library), `private: true` (service)
   - Precedence when signals conflict: `private: true` → service; `bin` → distributable; `main`/`exports` → distributable. If no signals found, default to `dependencies` (service)
   - Ask user to confirm: is this a **service** (deployed, not distributed) or **distributable** (npm package, CLI tool, library)?
   - In non-interactive mode (`--yes` flag or CI environment), auto-select based on heuristic precedence without prompting
   - Services use `dependencies` — OTel packages are runtime requirements
   - Distributables use `peerDependencies` — consumers decide whether to install OTel
   - Records choice as `dependencyStrategy` in config

4. **Create config file**
   - Writes `telemetry-agent.yaml` with schema path, SDK init file path, dependency strategy, and settings
   - Config file is the gate for instrumentation phase

### Prerequisites (verified during init)

1. **`package.json`** — provides namespace
2. **OTel SDK initialized** — user's responsibility, not agent's job. Init phase records the file path.
3. **`@opentelemetry/api` as peerDependency** — must be a `peerDependency`, never a direct production dependency. Multiple instances in `node_modules` cause silent trace loss via no-op fallbacks (see opentelemetry-js-contrib GUIDELINES.md). Minimum version: compatible with OTel JS SDK 2.0+. The allowlist in this spec is sourced from `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node` v0.68.0's package list, but the agent does NOT use that mega-bundle — it installs individual instrumentation packages.
4. **OTLP endpoint configured** — for production use (Datadog, Jaeger, etc.). During validation, agent temporarily overrides to point at Weaver.
5. **Test suite exists** — for validation (agent warns if missing). The `testCommand` config accepts any runner (npm test, vitest, jest, nx test, etc.) — fine for PoC with npm, note for post-PoC that arbitrary runners should be well-supported.

## How It Works

### Input
- Config file (`telemetry-agent.yaml`) — must exist (created by init)
- Weaver schema (resolved from path in config)
- File or directory path to instrument

### Processing (per file)
1. **Check imports** — what libraries/frameworks does this file use?
2. **Check schema for libraries** — does schema already specify instrumentation?
3. **Discover new libraries** — if not in schema, check allowlist then npm registry
4. **Record library needs** — add to result's `libraries_needed` with package name and import name (Coordinator handles installation and SDK registration later)
5. **Find business logic gaps** — code paths that libraries can't instrument
6. **Skip already-instrumented functions** — pattern match for `tracer.startActiveSpan` etc.
7. **Variable shadowing check** — before inserting `span`, `tracer`, or other OTel variables, use ts-morph scope analysis to check for existing variables with the same name. If collision detected, use suffixed names (`otelSpan`, `otelTracer`).
8. **For business logic gaps only:**
   - Determine needed attributes
   - Check semconv first, then existing schema, then create new
   - Add manual span
9. **Update Weaver schema** if new libraries/attributes/spans added
10. **Per-file validation** — syntax → lint → Weaver static (fix loops, max attempts enforced)
11. **Return result** to Coordinator

### Output
- Single PR with all changes (code + schema updates + SDK init + package.json)
- Validation results rendered in PR description

## File/Directory Processing

- **User specifies:** file or directory
- **Directory processing:** sequential, one file at a time
- **New AI instance per file:** prevents laziness, ensures quality
- **Schema changes propagate:** via git commits on feature branch
- **SDK init file:** written once by Coordinator after all agents complete
- **Dependency installation:** one bulk `npm install` by Coordinator after all agents complete
- **Single PR at end:** contains all instrumented files, schema updates, SDK init changes, and package.json updates. The per-file commits (one per successful file) are operational artifacts for revert granularity during the run — the PR should be squash-merged, with the PR description serving as the sole record of per-file detail
- **Configurable file limit:** Default 50 files per run (configurable via `maxFilesPerRun`). This is a cost/time guardrail, not an architectural constraint — the Coordinator's design (centralized SDK writes, in-memory results, independent agents) supports higher file counts without structural changes. If the glob returns more files than the limit, the Coordinator fails with an error suggesting the user adjust the limit or target a subdirectory.

### File Revert Protocol

The Coordinator snapshots each file before handing it to the Instrumentation Agent. If the agent returns a `"failed"` status (e.g., syntax errors it couldn't fix after max attempts), the Coordinator reverts the file to its pre-agent state before continuing to the next file. This ensures the feature branch remains compilable even with partial failures.

Implementation: The Coordinator copies the file (and its corresponding schema state if the agent modified it) to a temp location before processing. On failure, it restores from the snapshot and discards the agent's changes. On success, it commits the agent's changes to the feature branch.

### Periodic Schema Checkpoints

To catch schema drift early instead of discovering it only at end-of-run, the Coordinator runs `weaver registry check` every `schemaCheckpointInterval` files (default: 5). Alongside validation, the Coordinator runs `weaver registry diff --baseline-registry <snapshot> -r ./telemetry/registry --diff-format json` to capture exactly what changed since the last checkpoint. This makes checkpoint output actionable — not just "valid/invalid" but "here's what was added."

If a checkpoint fails, the Coordinator stops processing new files by default. Files committed before the failing checkpoint are valid (they passed their own validations and all previous checkpoints), so the Coordinator still creates a PR with the partial results — the PR summary notes the checkpoint failure and identifies which files were processed since the last successful checkpoint (the blast radius). This is consistent with the fail-forward philosophy: don't waste work that already succeeded. Interface layers can override this behavior by providing an `onSchemaCheckpoint` callback that returns `true` to continue processing despite the failure; returning `false` or `void` (or not providing the callback) stops processing.

### SDK Init File Parsing Scope

The Coordinator supports SDK init files using the `NodeSDK` constructor pattern with an `instrumentations` array literal. It uses ts-morph to find the array, append new entries, and add corresponding import statements. If the SDK init file doesn't match a recognized pattern (e.g., instrumentations are constructed dynamically, spread from another file, or use `registerInstrumentations()`), the Coordinator writes a separate file (e.g., `telemetry-agent-instrumentations.ts`) exporting the new instrumentation instances, logs a warning with instructions for the user to integrate manually, and notes this in the PR summary. This keeps the Coordinator deterministic without requiring it to understand arbitrary SDK initialization patterns.

### Future: Parallel Processing

The architecture supports parallelism without structural changes: agents are independent (no shared state, no cross-file context), results are in-memory, and shared resources (SDK init, package.json) are written by the Coordinator after all agents complete. The only hard problem is schema merging — two parallel agents might create conflicting schema entries. A Coordinator-level merge strategy (collect all schema changes, deduplicate, write once) would address this. Raising `maxFilesPerRun` beyond the default requires no architecture changes, just longer run times.

## What Gets Instrumented

### Instrumentation Priority Hierarchy

The agent follows a priority hierarchy when deciding what to instrument. Each function is evaluated against these tiers in order:

1. **External calls** — Functions making DB, HTTP, gRPC, or message queue calls. These are service boundaries where traces provide the most diagnostic value.
2. **Schema-defined spans** — Spans explicitly defined in the Weaver schema. The human already decided these matter.
3. **Service-layer entry points** — Exported async functions in service/handler directories not already covered by tiers 1 or 2.
4. **Everything else is skipped** — Utilities, formatters, pure helpers, synchronous internals. The agent does not instrument these. As a concrete heuristic: functions under ~5 lines, pure synchronous functions, type guards, and simple data transformations should never be instrumented regardless of where they live in the codebase.

The agent should be able to articulate which tier each instrumented function falls into. This categorization is recorded in the result (see `span_categories` in Result Data).

**Ratio-based backstop:** If the agent finds itself wanting to add manual spans to more than ~20% of the functions in a file, this is a signal the file may need to be broken up or the agent is over-instrumenting. The agent should flag this in the result rather than proceeding.

### Review Sensitivity

The `reviewSensitivity` config controls how the Coordinator annotates the PR summary. It does not change the agent's behavior — the agent always follows the same priority hierarchy.

```yaml
reviewSensitivity: moderate  # strict | moderate | off
```

- **strict** — The PR summary flags any file where the agent added spans beyond the top two priority tiers (external calls + schema-defined). Outlier detection uses tighter thresholds. Use when you want to review everything that isn't obviously correct.
- **moderate** (default) — Flag only statistical outliers: files where span count is significantly above the per-run average. Include the per-file category breakdown table in the PR summary. Use when you want to know if something looks unusual.
- **off** — The category breakdown table still appears in the PR summary (it's useful documentation), but no warnings or flags are emitted.

### Schema guidance
- Schema defines attribute groups and naming patterns
- Schema can define specific spans for critical paths (overrides heuristics)
- Agent applies schema conventions to discovered instrumentation points

### Patterns Not Covered (PoC)

The PoC focuses on request-path functions (handlers, services, external calls). These async/event-driven patterns are common in TypeScript services but are not covered:

- Event handlers / event emitters
- Pub/sub callbacks
- Cron jobs / scheduled tasks
- Queue consumers

These patterns require trace context propagation across asynchronous boundaries (event loops, message queues, scheduled invocations) that the current span-wrapping approach doesn't handle. The agent would need to inject context carriers, which is a fundamentally different transformation pattern from wrapping synchronous or single-async function bodies.

---

## What the Agent Actually Does to Code

Two paths: auto-instrumentation (common) and manual spans (fallback).

### Path 1: Auto-Instrumentation Library (Primary)

Agent detects a framework import and records the library need. The Coordinator handles registration.

**Scenario:** File imports `pg` (PostgreSQL client)

**Step 1: Agent detects import in target file**
```typescript
// src/services/user-service.ts
import { Pool } from 'pg';

export async function getUser(id: string) {
  const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);
  return result.rows[0];
}
```

**Step 2: Agent records library need in result**
```json
{
  "libraries_needed": [
    {
      "package": "@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg",
      "importName": "PgInstrumentation"
    }
  ]
}
```

The agent does NOT modify the SDK init file. The Coordinator handles this after all agents complete. The agent reports the full library requirement (package + import name) so the Coordinator can write the SDK file deterministically — see Result Data for details.

**Step 3: Coordinator writes SDK init file (once, after all agents)**
```typescript
// src/telemetry/setup.ts (path from config's sdkInitFile)
import { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node';
import { PgInstrumentation } from '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg';

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: 'commit-story',
  instrumentations: [
    new PgInstrumentation(),
  ],
});
sdk.start();
```

**Step 4: Agent updates Weaver schema**
```yaml
# telemetry/registry/signals.yaml (added)
groups:
  - id: span.commit_story.db.pg
    type: span
    brief: PostgreSQL database operations (via instrumentation-pg)
    span_kind: client
    note: Auto-instrumentation library handles span creation
    attributes:
      - ref: db.system
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: db.namespace
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: db.operation.name
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: db.statement
        requirement_level: recommended
```

**Key point:** The target file (`user-service.ts`) is NOT modified. The library handles instrumentation automatically once registered.

**Schema vs. Runtime Dependencies:** The schema entry (Step 4) and `libraries_needed` (Step 2) serve different purposes and both are required. The schema defines the telemetry contract — what spans will be emitted and what attributes they'll have. This enables Weaver live-check to validate that the running code produces what the schema says it should. The `libraries_needed` array tells the Coordinator which npm packages to install and which classes to import and register in the SDK init file — the agent provides both the package name and the import name so the Coordinator can write the SDK file deterministically. You can't have validation without the schema entry, and you can't have working instrumentation without the library installed. They're complementary, not redundant.

### Path 2: Manual Span (Fallback for Business Logic)

Agent wraps business logic that no library can instrument.

**Scenario:** Custom journal generation function

**Before:**
```typescript
// src/generators/summary.ts
export async function generateSummary(context: Context): Promise<string> {
  const filtered = filterContext(context);
  const prompt = buildPrompt(filtered);
  const response = await callAI(prompt);
  return response.content;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// src/generators/summary.ts
import { trace, SpanStatusCode } from '@opentelemetry/api';

const tracer = trace.getTracer('commit-story');

export async function generateSummary(context: Context): Promise<string> {
  return tracer.startActiveSpan('commit_story.journal.generate_summary', async (span) => {
    try {
      span.setAttribute('commit_story.context.messages_count', context.messages.length);

      const filtered = filterContext(context);
      const prompt = buildPrompt(filtered);
      const response = await callAI(prompt);

      span.setAttribute('commit_story.journal.word_count', response.content.split(' ').length);
      return response.content;
    } catch (error) {
      span.recordException(error);
      span.setStatus({ code: SpanStatusCode.ERROR });
      throw error;
    } finally {
      span.end();
    }
  });
}
```

**Variable shadowing note:** Before inserting `span` and `tracer`, the agent uses ts-morph's scope analysis to verify these names don't collide with existing variables. If `span` already exists in scope, the agent uses `otelSpan` instead (and adjusts all references). If `tracer` exists, it uses `otelTracer`. This prevents silent runtime bugs that would pass all validation.

**Schema entry created:**
```yaml
# telemetry/registry/signals.yaml (added)
groups:
  - id: span.commit_story.journal.generate_summary
    type: span
    stability: development
    brief: AI-powered journal summary generation
    span_kind: internal
    attributes:
      - ref: commit_story.context.messages_count
        requirement_level: recommended
      - ref: commit_story.journal.word_count
        requirement_level: recommended
```

### Decision: Which Path?

| Import Detected | OTel Library Exists? | Action |
|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| `pg`, `express`, `http`, etc. | Yes | Path 1: Record library need for Coordinator |
| Custom business logic | N/A | Path 2: Wrap with manual span |
| Already instrumented | N/A | Skip |

---

## Attribute Priority Chain

When agent needs an attribute:

1. **Check OTel semantic conventions** — use semconv reference if exists
2. **Check existing Weaver schema** — use if already defined
3. **Neither exists** — create new custom attribute under project namespace

**Agent has full authority to extend schema** (create spans, attributes, groups) — within the guardrails below.

### Schema Extension Guardrails

The agent can extend the schema, but must follow existing patterns:

1. **Namespace prefix is mandatory** — New attributes MUST use the project namespace prefix as defined in the existing schema. If the schema uses `commit_story.*`, all new attributes must follow that prefix.

2. **Follow existing structural patterns** — New attribute groups should match the naming and structural conventions already present in the user-provided schema.

3. **Add or create, but stay consistent** — Agent can add to existing groups or create new ones, but must observe and follow the conventions in the existing schema.

4. **Coordinator enforces via drift detection** — The Coordinator sums `attributes_created` and `spans_added` across all results. Unreasonable totals (e.g., 30 new attributes for a single file) get flagged for human review. Additionally, `weaver registry diff` (with `--diff-format json`) classifies each schema change as `added`, `renamed`, `updated`, `obsoleted`, or `removed`. The Coordinator can reject any change type other than `added` to enforce the "extend only" constraint programmatically.

---

## Auto-Instrumentation Libraries

**Libraries are the PRIMARY approach.** Manual spans are only for gaps.

### Why Libraries First
- Auto-instrumentation libraries are battle-tested
- They handle framework internals correctly (middleware, connection pooling, etc.)
- Less code to maintain
- Follows OTel best practices

### Detection Flow
1. **Check schema first** — does schema already reference an auto-instrumentation library for this file's imports?
   - If yes → record library need (schema is source of truth)
2. **Discovery** — if file uses a framework not in schema (e.g., `import express from 'express'`):
   - Check allowlist first, then query npm registry as fallback
   - If found and `autoApproveLibraries: true`:
     - Record library in result's `libraries_needed`
     - Add library's spans/attributes to Weaver schema (semconv references)
   - If found and `autoApproveLibraries: false` → prompt user

### Library Discovery

**Approach:** Hardcoded allowlist first, npm registry as fallback.

**Trusted Allowlist (PoC)**

Common OTel JS instrumentation packages. Note: this allowlist should be reviewed quarterly against upstream package lists, as packages may be deprecated or replaced (see Fastify below).

**Core (from `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`)**

| Framework/Library | Instrumentation Package |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `http` / `https` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` |
| `express` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-express` |
| `pg` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg` |
| `mysql` / `mysql2` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-mysql` / `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-mysql2` |
| `mongodb` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-mongodb` |
| `redis` / `ioredis` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-redis` / `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-ioredis` |
| `grpc` / `@grpc/grpc-js` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-grpc` |
| `koa` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-koa` |
| `fastify` | `@fastify/otel` (note: `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fastify` is deprecated as of auto-instrumentations-node v0.68.0, Feb 2026) |
| `nestjs` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-nestjs-core` |
| `mongoose` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-mongoose` |
| `kafkajs` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-kafkajs` |
| `pino` | `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pino` |

**OpenLLMetry — LLM Providers (from `@traceloop/node-server-sdk`)**

| Framework/Library | Instrumentation Package |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-anthropic` |
| `openai` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-openai` |
| `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-bedrock` |
| `@google-cloud/vertexai` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-vertexai` |
| `cohere-ai` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-cohere` |
| `together-ai` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-together` |

**OpenLLMetry — Frameworks**

| Framework/Library | Instrumentation Package |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `langchain` / `@langchain/*` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-langchain` |
| `llamaindex` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-llamaindex` |

**OpenLLMetry — Protocols**

| Framework/Library | Instrumentation Package |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-mcp` |

**OpenLLMetry — Vector Databases**

| Framework/Library | Instrumentation Package |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `@pinecone-database/pinecone` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-pinecone` |
| `chromadb` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-chromadb` |
| `@qdrant/js-client-rest` | `@traceloop/instrumentation-qdrant` |

**Note on OpenLLMetry packages:** The `@traceloop/instrumentation-*` packages are from [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry-js), OTel extensions for LLM observability created by Traceloop. Their work contributed to the official GenAI semantic conventions now in OTel. These packages provide auto-instrumentation for LLM/AI SDK calls and emit `gen_ai.*` semconv attributes. All 12 JS/TS packages are also bundled in `@traceloop/node-server-sdk`. For codebases with LLM integrations, these provide the same benefits as other auto-instrumentation libraries — no manual span wrapping needed.

**npm Registry Search (Fallback)**

If a file imports a framework not in the allowlist, the agent queries npm as a discovery mechanism. This is best-effort — the allowlist is the trusted set.

**Future:** Vector database synced with OTel ecosystem

### Schema Updates for Libraries
When a library is added, the schema should reference what it produces:
```yaml
# Example: express instrumentation added
groups:
  - id: span.myapp.http.server
    type: span
    brief: HTTP server spans from express instrumentation
    span_kind: server
    attributes:
      - ref: http.request.method
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: url.path
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: http.response.status_code
        requirement_level: required
      - ref: http.route
        requirement_level: recommended
```

This enables Weaver live-check to validate library output.

### Manual Spans (Secondary)
Only add manual spans for:
- Business logic that libraries can't see
- Custom operations with no framework equivalent
- Schema-defined critical paths

Agent does NOT add manual spans for things libraries already handle.

---

## Validation Chain

Validation stays in the Instrumentation Agent so it can fix what it breaks. The Coordinator enforces limits and handles failures.

### Per-File Validation (with fix loops)

Each check runs in a loop: validate → fix errors → retry until clean or max attempts reached.

1. **Syntax** — TypeScript compiler / ts-morph (code must compile)
2. **Lint** — Prettier/ESLint (code must be properly formatted)
3. **Weaver registry check** — static schema validation

Order matters: syntax first (must compile), then lint, then schema.

**Fix loop limits:** The agent retries up to `maxFixAttempts` (default: 3) per validation stage. If the agent cannot produce clean code within the limit, it returns a `"failed"` status and the Coordinator reverts the file. The `maxTokensPerFile` budget (default: 50,000) provides a hard ceiling on total token usage per file across all attempts. The Coordinator enforces this by summing `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` and `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens` from each API call's response metadata during the fix loop. If cumulative usage exceeds the budget, the Coordinator stops retries and treats the file as failed, regardless of remaining `maxFixAttempts`.

**Variable shadowing check:** Before inserting new variables (`span`, `tracer`, etc.), the agent uses ts-morph's scope analysis (TypeScript binder access) to check for existing variables with the same name in the target scope. If a collision is detected, the agent uses suffixed names (`otelSpan`, `otelTracer`) or reports the collision and skips instrumentation for that function. This check happens before the validation loop — it's a pre-condition, not something that gets "fixed" in a retry.

### End-of-Run Validation (once, after all files)

These are slow, so they run once before creating the PR. They run after the Coordinator has completed SDK init file writes and dependency installation.

1. **Run tests with Weaver live-check**

Weaver acts as an OTLP receiver itself — no external collector needed for validation.

```text
Agent workflow:
1. Start Weaver: weaver registry live-check -r ./registry
   → Listens on localhost:4317 (gRPC) and :4320 (HTTP /stop)

2. Run tests with endpoint override:
   OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317 npm test
   → Tests exercise code, telemetry goes to Weaver

3. Stop Weaver: curl localhost:4320/stop
   → Weaver outputs compliance report

4. Parse results:
   → Coverage stats, violations, advisories by severity
```

The agent temporarily overrides the OTLP endpoint during validation. Normal production telemetry goes to the user's configured backend. See the `testCommand` implementation note in the Configuration section for details on environment variable inheritance.

### Future Optimizations
- Smart test discovery (only tests touching changed files)
- Backend verification (query Datadog/Jaeger to confirm data arrived)

### If Tests Don't Exist
- Agent warns user
- Skips live-check validation
- Per-file validations still run

---

## Agent Self-Instrumentation

How the telemetry agent instruments its own operations.

### Bootstrapping

The agent cannot instrument itself using itself — that's circular. Its own instrumentation is hand-written, a fixed known set of spans covering the agent's workflow. This is distinct from the instrumentation it adds to target codebases.

### Separate Telemetry Pipelines

The agent maintains two independent telemetry streams that must not cross:

| Pipeline | Destination | Purpose |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Target codebase telemetry | Weaver (validation) → user's backend (production) | What the agent creates |
| Agent operational telemetry | Developer's observability backend (e.g., Datadog) | Debugging the agent itself |

The OTLP endpoint override during Weaver live-check applies only to the target codebase's SDK, not to the agent's own exporter.

### Coordinator Spans (one trace per run)

| Span | Attributes |
|------|------------|
| `telemetry_agent.run` | Parent span for entire instrumentation run |
| | `files.attempted`, `files.succeeded`, `files.failed` |
| | `duration_ms` |
| | `schema_drift.attributes_created`, `schema_drift.spans_added` (totals from results) |
| | `validation.tests_passed`, `validation.weaver_compliance` (end-of-run outcomes) |

### Instrumentation Agent Spans (child spans per file)

Nested under the Coordinator's trace:

| Span | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `telemetry_agent.file.process` | Parent span per file |
| `telemetry_agent.file.analyze` | File analysis (imports detected, frameworks found) |
| `telemetry_agent.file.discover_libraries` | Library lookup (allowlist hit or npm fallback, what was found) |
| `telemetry_agent.file.transform` | Code transformation (manual spans added, libraries recorded) |
| `telemetry_agent.file.validate` | Validation loop iteration (syntax/lint/Weaver, pass or fail) |

`telemetry_agent.file.validate` should include attributes for `retry_count` and `check_failed` (which check failed if any).

LLM calls should use `gen_ai.*` semconv attributes: `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens`, `gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, latency.

### Trace Context Propagation

The Coordinator creates the root span and must propagate trace context to each Instrumentation Agent instance. Since each agent is a fresh LLM API call (direct Anthropic SDK), the Coordinator passes the trace context (trace ID + parent span ID) as parameters in the system prompt or tool input, and wraps the API call with the appropriate child span on the Coordinator side. There is no built-in OTel context propagation for LLM API calls — this must be handled manually by the Coordinator.

### PoC Scope

**Minimum:** Coordinator-level spans and LLM call spans with `gen_ai.*` attributes.

**Nice-to-have:** Per-phase child spans within the Instrumentation Agent.

The Weaver schema for the agent itself (as opposed to target codebases) is a separate registry that lives in the agent's own repo.

---

## Handling Existing Instrumentation

### Already instrumented (complete)
- Pattern match for `tracer.startActiveSpan`, `tracer.startSpan`, etc.
- Skip the function

### Broken instrumentation
- Agent is **additive only** — doesn't try to detect/fix broken patterns
- Weaver validation catches issues
- Agent fixes what Weaver reports

### Telemetry removed by user
- If user deletes instrumentation but schema still defines it
- Agent re-instruments according to schema (schema is source of truth)
- If user wants telemetry gone: don't feed file to agent

---

## Schema as Source of Truth

- Weaver schema defines what SHOULD be instrumented
- Agent implements the contract
- Agent can EXTEND schema (with semconv check)
- Code follows schema, not the other way around

---

## Result Data

Each Instrumentation Agent returns a result object to the Coordinator. Results are held in-memory during the run — no filesystem directory, no committed JSON files.

### Why In-Memory Results

Results are collected by the Coordinator as it processes each file sequentially. Since the Coordinator is a single process running a simple loop, it already has all results in memory by the time it needs them. No inter-process communication, no filesystem coordination, no cleanup.

For debugging, the Coordinator can optionally write results to a gitignored directory when configured with verbose or debug mode (exposed as a config field; interface layers map their own flags to it). This is a debug aid, not architecture.

### Result Structure

```typescript
interface LibraryRequirement {
  package: string;       // npm package name, e.g. "@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg"
  importName: string;    // class to import, e.g. "PgInstrumentation"
}

interface FileResult {
  path: string;
  status: "success" | "failed";
  spans_added: number;
  libraries_needed: LibraryRequirement[];  // Coordinator handles installation + SDK registration
  schema_extensions: string[];              // IDs of new schema entries
  attributes_created: number;
  validation_retries: number;
  span_categories?: {                       // optional — not present on early failures
    external_calls: number;
    schema_defined: number;
    service_entry_points: number;
    total_functions_in_file: number;        // denominator for ratio-based backstop
  };
  notes?: string[];                         // agent's judgment call explanations
  schemaHashBefore?: string;                // hash of resolved schema before agent ran
  schemaHashAfter?: string;                 // hash of resolved schema after agent ran
  agentVersion?: string;                    // version of agent/prompt that produced this result
  reason?: string;                          // human-readable summary, e.g. "syntax errors after 3 fix attempts"
  last_error?: string;                      // raw error output for debugging, e.g. "Unexpected token at line 42"
}
```

The agent reports the full library requirement (package name + import name) because it has the file context to determine the correct import. This keeps the Coordinator deterministic — it can write the SDK init file without needing allowlist lookups.

The `notes` field lets the agent explain judgment calls — e.g., "skipped processPayment because it's already wrapped in a span from an outer function" or "this file has unusually deep nesting; consider refactoring before instrumenting." These notes flow into the PR summary and make the PR reviewable by someone who wasn't watching the agent work.

Schema hashes let the Coordinator trace exactly which agent introduced a schema change. If end-of-run Weaver validation fails, the Coordinator can identify the file whose schema modification caused the failure by comparing hashes across the result sequence. This is a cheap diagnostic — just a fast hash of the resolved schema JSON — not a full diff. The hash should be computed on canonicalized JSON (sorted keys, no whitespace) to avoid spurious differences from non-deterministic key ordering in Weaver's output.

The `agentVersion` field tracks which version of the agent (or system prompt) produced each result. During prompt iteration — especially during the RS1 research spike — this lets you compare results across prompt versions and identify which changes improved or degraded output quality. Even a manually-bumped string (e.g., "v0.3-prompt-experiment") is useful. The Coordinator includes the agent version in the PR description.

Success example:
```json

### PR Summary

The Coordinator renders results into the PR description as a human-readable summary. This is the primary way reviewers see what the agent did. The PR description includes:

- Per-file status, spans added, libraries discovered, schema extensions, and any failures with reasons
- **Per-file span category breakdown table** — shows how many spans fall into each priority tier per file (always included regardless of `reviewSensitivity` setting)
- **Schema changes summary** — generated via `weaver registry diff --diff-format markdown`, showing all attributes, spans, and other telemetry objects added to the registry during the run. Gives reviewers a clear picture of schema evolution without inspecting registry YAML files directly.
- **Review sensitivity annotations** — warnings or flags based on the configured sensitivity level (see Review Sensitivity under What Gets Instrumented)
- **Agent notes** — judgment call explanations from each file's result, surfaced inline with the per-file summary
- **Token usage data** — pre-run ceiling (based on file count and sizes) alongside actual token usage from `gen_ai.usage.*` attributes in agent self-instrumentation spans. The side-by-side comparison shows how conservative the ceiling was and helps calibrate expectations for future runs. (See Cost Visibility under Configuration.)
- **Agent version** — which agent/prompt version produced the results (useful for comparing across prompt iterations)

This builds trust with reviewers without polluting the git history with machine-readable artifacts.

### Schema Hash Tracking

Each agent can extend the schema, and extensions propagate via git commits. The `schemaHashBefore` and `schemaHashAfter` fields in each result let the Coordinator trace exactly which file's agent introduced a schema change. If Agent C's extension conflicts with Agent B's, the Coordinator can pinpoint the divergence by walking the hash sequence. Periodic schema checkpoints and end-of-run Weaver validation catch the resulting errors. When hashes differ, `weaver registry diff` shows the actual changes — not just "something changed" but "these attributes/spans were added." The Coordinator snapshots the registry directory at the start of the run and uses it as the `--baseline-registry` for diff operations.

---

## Configuration

The config file is created during `telemetry-agent init` and serves as the gate for instrumentation. If no config file exists, the Instrumentation Agent refuses to run.

```yaml
# telemetry-agent.yaml (created by init, checked into repo)

# Required
schemaPath: ./telemetry/registry         # Path to Weaver registry directory
sdkInitFile: ./src/telemetry/setup.ts    # OTel SDK initialization file (recorded during init)

# Agent behavior
autoApproveLibraries: true    # false = prompt before adding OTel libraries
testCommand: "npm test"        # Command to run test suite during validation (supports npm, vitest, jest, nx, etc.)

# Dependency strategy (set during init based on project type)
dependencyStrategy: dependencies  # dependencies (services) | peerDependencies (distributable packages/CLIs/libraries)

# Limits and guardrails
maxFilesPerRun: 50             # Cost/time guardrail, user adjustable
maxFixAttempts: 3              # Max validation retry attempts per file before reverting
maxTokensPerFile: 50000        # Token budget ceiling per file (all fix attempts combined)
schemaCheckpointInterval: 5    # Run schema validation checkpoint after every N files

# Review
reviewSensitivity: moderate    # PR annotation strictness: strict (flag tier 3+), moderate (outliers only), off (no warnings)

# Execution mode
dryRun: false                  # true = run agents but revert all changes, output summary only (no branch, PR, or commits)
confirmEstimate: true          # CLI only. true = print cost ceiling and prompt before processing. No effect on MCP (uses get-cost-ceiling tool) or GitHub Action (always --yes)

# File filtering
exclude:                        # Glob patterns to skip
  - "**/*.test.ts"
  - "**/*.spec.ts"
  - "src/generated/**"          # SDK init file is auto-excluded regardless of this list

# Future (not implemented in PoC, reserved for post-PoC)
# instrumentationMode: balanced  # thorough | balanced | minimal
```

> **Implementation note (`testCommand`):** The test command runs with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` overridden to point at Weaver during validation. Verify that the test runner correctly inherits environment variables — `execSync` with env override behaves differently than `spawn` with env inheritance, and meta-runners like nx or turbo may spawn subprocesses that don't inherit the override. For PoC, `npm test` with `execSync` and explicit env is sufficient. Consider validating env var inheritance during init (e.g., a smoke test that confirms the endpoint value propagates through the test runner) and failing with a clear error if it doesn't.

### What Goes Where

| In Config | In Schema |
|-----------|-----------|
| Schema path | Namespace (authoritative) |
| SDK init file path | Semconv version |
| Test command | Attribute definitions |
| Agent behavior settings | Span definitions |
| Dependency strategy | |
| Limits and guardrails | |
| Review sensitivity | |
| Execution mode (dry run) | |
| Cost ceiling confirmation | |
| File exclude patterns | |

The config tells the agent **how to run**. The schema tells it **what telemetry looks like**.

Note: OTLP endpoint for production is configured in the user's OTel SDK setup, not here. During validation, the agent temporarily uses Weaver as the receiver.

### Dry Run Mode

When `dryRun: true`, the Coordinator runs the full analysis pipeline — file globbing, agent spawning, result collection — but treats every file as a revert: each agent runs normally (transforms the file, extends the schema, returns its result), then the Coordinator restores the file from its snapshot instead of committing. No branch is created, no npm install runs, no PR is created. The Coordinator captures `weaver registry diff` output before reverting schema changes, so the dry run summary includes what schema extensions *would* have been made. The Coordinator then outputs the collected results as a summary (same format as the PR description). This reuses the existing snapshot/revert mechanism — dry run is just "revert every file regardless of success."

This is useful during prompt tuning and calibration: you can run the agent against your codebase repeatedly without creating throwaway branches. The agents still make LLM API calls (and incur token costs), but no persistent filesystem or git state is modified.

**Dry run skips periodic schema checkpoints.** Since schema changes are reverted after each file, checkpoints would validate a transient state that won't persist. The per-file validation chain (syntax → lint → Weaver static) still runs within each agent — that feedback is useful for the dry run summary.

### Exclude Patterns

The Coordinator applies exclude patterns after globbing. The SDK init file path (from `sdkInitFile`) is automatically excluded — the agent should not instrument the file that the Coordinator manages. Test files are excluded by default; override with an empty `exclude` list if you want the agent to consider them.

### Instrumentation Mode (Reserved)

The `instrumentationMode` setting is reserved for post-PoC. It would control how aggressively the agent applies the priority hierarchy: `thorough` instruments tier 3 (service entry points) more liberally, `minimal` sticks strictly to tiers 1 and 2, and `balanced` uses the agent's judgment. For the PoC, the agent always operates in `balanced` mode. The commented-out YAML key documents the intent; the Zod config validation schema should include it as an optional recognized field so future usage doesn't trigger an "unknown field" error.

### Config Validation

The Coordinator validates the config at startup using a Zod schema (or equivalent runtime validator). Invalid or unknown fields produce clear error messages — e.g., `Unknown config field 'maxSpanPerFile' — did you mean 'maxFixAttempts'?`. This catches typos and stale config from earlier spec versions. The validation schema is the single source of truth for config shape; the YAML block above is documentation, not the implementation.

### Dependency Strategy

The `dependencyStrategy` config controls how the Coordinator adds OTel packages to `package.json`. This is set during `telemetry-agent init` based on the project type.

**`@opentelemetry/api` is always a peerDependency** regardless of strategy. The OTel JS contrib GUIDELINES.md mandates this — multiple instances in `node_modules` cause silent trace loss via no-op fallbacks. The dependency strategy only affects **instrumentation packages** discovered and installed by the agent (e.g., `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-pg`, `@traceloop/instrumentation-anthropic`). The agent does not install or modify SDK packages — those are the user's responsibility (see Prerequisites).

| Strategy | Project Type | Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `dependencies` (default) | Services — backend APIs, workers, controllers deployed to servers/clusters | Instrumentation packages added to `dependencies`. They're runtime requirements and the package isn't distributed via npm. |
| `peerDependencies` | Distributable packages — npm libraries, CLI tools, anything consumers `npm install` | Instrumentation packages added to `peerDependencies`. Consumers who want telemetry install the packages themselves; consumers who don't get no-op API calls with zero overhead. |

When `dependencyStrategy: peerDependencies`, the Coordinator runs `npm install --save-peer` instead of `npm install --save`. The SDK init file is still written (it serves as a reference implementation), but the PR summary notes that consumers must install the peer dependencies for telemetry to be active. The Coordinator also adds `peerDependenciesMeta` with `optional: true` for each OTel peer dependency — this suppresses npm install warnings for consumers who don't want telemetry, aligning with the optional telemetry pattern.

**Note:** The `optional: true` flag suppresses npm warnings but does not make the packages functionally optional. Consumers must install `@opentelemetry/api` because the instrumented code contains hard imports (e.g., `import { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'`). The "optional" designation means consumers can choose *not to initialize the SDK*, resulting in no-op spans with zero overhead — but the API package itself must be present for imports to resolve.

### Cost Visibility

Cost visibility has two phases: a pre-run ceiling and post-run actuals. Both appear in the PR summary; the ceiling is additionally surfaced before the run begins when `confirmEstimate` is enabled.

**Pre-run ceiling:** After file globbing (step 3b in the workflow), the Coordinator calculates a cost ceiling: `fileCount × maxTokensPerFile`. With `maxTokensPerFile: 50000` and the default 50-file limit, the worst-case ceiling is 2.5M tokens per run. Actual usage will be significantly lower — most files won't hit the per-file ceiling, and not all files will require fix loop retries. This is a ceiling, not an estimate: it's a simple, clearly-defined worst case. Tighter ceilings based on file sizes or historical data are future work (see Out of Scope).

When `confirmEstimate: true`, the Coordinator fires the `onCostCeilingReady` callback, giving the interface layer an opportunity to surface the ceiling and request user confirmation before incurring token costs. If the user declines, the run aborts with no LLM calls made. When `confirmEstimate: false`, the ceiling is still calculated (it appears in the PR summary) but no confirmation is requested.

**Post-run actuals:** After the run completes, the Coordinator reports actual token usage from `gen_ai.usage.*` attributes in agent self-instrumentation spans. The PR summary includes both the pre-run ceiling and actual usage side by side, so reviewers can see how actual usage compared to the ceiling.

The `confirmEstimate` setting defaults to `true`. Interface-layer overrides: the CLI supports `--yes`/`-y` to skip the prompt (useful for scripting); the GitHub Action always passes `--yes` since it's non-interactive; the MCP server handles confirmation through its own two-tool flow (`get-cost-ceiling` then `instrument`) and passes `confirmEstimate: false` to the Coordinator. The file limit and `maxTokensPerFile` remain the primary cost guards — the ceiling confirmation is an additional layer of visibility, not the primary guardrail.

## Minimum Viable Schema Example

A complete, valid Weaver schema that passes `weaver registry check`. Based on commit-story-v2.

**Location:** `telemetry/registry/`

### registry_manifest.yaml

```yaml
# The root manifest — defines namespace and pulls in OTel semconv
name: commit_story
description: OpenTelemetry semantic conventions for commit-story
semconv_version: 0.1.0
schema_base_url: https://commit-story.dev/schemas/

# Import official OTel semantic conventions
# The [model] suffix specifies the subdirectory containing registry files
dependencies:
  - name: otel
    registry_path: https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/archive/refs/tags/v1.37.0.zip[model]
```

**Semconv version note:** This example pins to v1.37.0. The latest release is v1.39.0, which includes significant GenAI semconv updates (`gen_ai.conversation.id`, reasoning content message parts, multimodal support, agent span kind guidance) and the database semconv stability push where `db.name` is being replaced by `db.namespace` (v1.38.0+). For the PoC, v1.37.0 is fine — but the `db.name` → `db.namespace` migration will be needed when upgrading. Consider bumping to v1.39.0 if GenAI conventions are important for commit-story-v2.

### attributes.yaml

```yaml
# Custom attributes for gaps not covered by OTel semconv

groups:
  # Span using OTel semconv attributes (for library instrumentation)
  - id: span.commit_story.db.operations
    type: span

```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate schema syntax and references
weaver registry check -r ./telemetry/registry

# Resolve and view (includes semconv from dependencies)
weaver registry resolve -r ./telemetry/registry -f json -o resolved.json
```

### Key Points

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `registry_manifest.yaml` | Namespace, semconv version, OTel dependency |
| `attributes.yaml` | Custom attributes + refs to OTel semconv |
| `signals.yaml` | Span definitions (library-backed and manual) |

The agent reads the resolved output, which includes all semconv references expanded inline.

## Resolved Questions

### Q1: Weaver Schema Structure
- **Scope problem:** Solved by requiring schema to exist before instrumentation (Schema Builder descoped from PoC)
- **Minimum viable schema:** See "Minimum Viable Schema Example" section above
- **commit-story-v2 reference:** `telemetry/registry/` contains a working example

### Q2: Live-Check Setup
Weaver acts as its own OTLP receiver:
- Agent starts `weaver registry live-check` (listens on :4317)
- Agent runs tests with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=localhost:4317`
- Agent stops Weaver via `curl localhost:4320/stop`
- Agent parses compliance report

No external collector needed for validation. Test suite needs no code changes — just environment variable override.

### Q3: Error Handling
**Approach:** Fail forward with file revert. Commit successful files, revert and skip failed ones, create PR with summary.

- Per-file failures → Coordinator reverts file to snapshot, continues to next
- End-of-run failures → note in PR, create anyway
- Partial success with clear reporting and a compilable branch

### Q4: Semconv Lookup
The agent doesn't need to look up semconv separately — it's already in the resolved schema.

- `registry_manifest.yaml` has a `dependencies` field that pulls in OTel semconv
- `weaver registry resolve` produces output with resolved semconv references
- Agent just reads the resolved JSON and has everything it needs

### Q5: Agent Framework Choice
**Resolved: Direct Anthropic TypeScript SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`)**

The architecture is deliberately simple — a deterministic Coordinator loop and one-shot LLM API calls per file. This doesn't require the complex state management, graph execution, or checkpointing that LangGraph provides. The direct SDK gives maximum control over prompts, full transparency for debugging, and zero framework dependencies. See "Technology Stack (PoC)" section for full rationale.

### Q6: Quality Checks for AI
Four levers:

1. **Fresh instance per file** — Prevents laziness, each file gets full attention
2. **Weaver validation chain** — Catches errors via static check and live-check
3. **Schema drift detection** — Coordinator sums `attributes_created` and `spans_added` across results; periodic schema checkpoints catch drift early; schema hash tracking pinpoints which file introduced a breaking change
4. **Priority hierarchy + review sensitivity** — The agent follows a strict instrumentation priority hierarchy (external calls → schema-defined → service entry points → skip everything else). The Coordinator annotates the PR summary based on the configured review sensitivity, flagging outliers for human review without gating the agent's output.

---

## Dependencies

### PRD 25 (Autonomous Dev Infrastructure)
- Should be completed first
- Provides testing infrastructure for this repo
- Agent doesn't depend on it architecturally (self-contained validation)
- But this repo benefits from having it

### Separate Repository
- Agent should live in its own repo
- commit-story-v2 is first test subject, not home
- Enables distribution to other codebases

---

## PoC Scope

### In Scope

**Prerequisites and setup:**
- Assumes target codebase already has OTel API and SDK installed, initialized, and a valid Weaver schema in place
- Pre-implementation research spikes (RS1: prompt engineering, RS2: Weaver integration approach, RS3: fix loop design)
- Mandatory init phase with prerequisite verification and SDK init file path recording
- Config validation (Zod schema)

**Architecture:**
- Coordinator (deterministic TypeScript script for orchestration)
- Coordinator programmatic API with progress callbacks
- Instrumentation Agent (per-file, via direct Anthropic SDK)
- Schema Builder Agent descoped (schema must exist)

**Interfaces:**
- MCP server interface
- CLI with JSON output mode and meaningful exit codes
- GitHub Action with workflow_dispatch trigger

**Instrumentation:**
- TypeScript support, traces only (no metrics/logs yet)
- Priority-based instrumentation hierarchy with configurable review sensitivity
- Allowlist-first library discovery with npm registry fallback
- Schema extension with semconv priority
- Variable shadowing checks via ts-morph scope analysis

**Execution:**
- File/directory input with configurable exclude patterns
- Sequential processing with fresh agent instance per file
- Configurable file limit (default 50)
- Dry run mode for prompt tuning and calibration
- Coordinator-managed SDK init file writes (single write after all agents)
- Coordinator-managed dependency installation (bulk npm install)
- File revert protocol (snapshot before agent, revert on failure)

**Validation:**
- Per-file validation with fix loops: syntax, lint, Weaver static (with max attempts and token budget)
- Periodic schema checkpoints
- End-of-run validation: tests, Weaver live-check

**Output:**
- In-memory result collection with PR description rendering
- PR output with span category breakdown, agent notes, and cost data
- Schema hash tracking and agent version tagging in results

### Out of Scope (Future)
- Schema Builder Agent (auto-generate schema from codebase discovery)
- Async/event-driven patterns (event emitters, pub/sub, cron jobs, queue consumers)
- Multi-agent for different signal types (separate metrics/logs/traces agents)
- Other languages
- Smart test discovery
- Vector database for OTel knowledge
- Backend verification (query observability platform)
- Configurable instrumentation levels (dev-heavy vs production-selective — `instrumentationMode` config key reserved)
- Parallel agent execution (architecture supports it; needs schema merge strategy)
- Tighter cost ceilings (file-size-proportional ceilings that account for system prompt and schema overhead, more accurate than the current `fileCount × maxTokensPerFile` worst case)
- Token usage estimation (heuristic-based estimates derived from historical ceiling-vs-actual data across runs, replacing conservative ceilings with realistic predictions)

## Research Summary

### Prior Art
- **o11y.ai** — AI-powered, TypeScript, generates PRs. Not schema-driven.
- **OllyGarden** — Insights (instrumentation scoring), Tulip (OTel Collector distribution, Oct 2025). Agentic instrumentation direction confirmed by co-founder Juraci at KubeCon NA 2025 and December 2025 panel.
- **Orchestrion (Datadog)** — Compile-time AST instrumentation for Go.

See "Why Schema-Driven?" in Vision section for why the gap matters.

### Optional Telemetry Pattern
- `@opentelemetry/api` has zero dependencies (~8-10KB)
- Use peer dependencies with optional flag
- Without SDK initialization, all API calls are automatic no-ops
- Agent can instrument code that works with or without OTel present

Relevant when the agent targets codebases that don't already have OTel installed (see Out of Scope — PoC assumes OTel is pre-installed).

### Instrumentation Level (Still Open)
- "Instrument everything" is NOT industry best practice for production
- Consensus: auto-instrumentation baseline + manual for business-critical paths
- v1's heavy dev instrumentation was intentional for AI debugging assistance
- Agent should eventually support configurable modes (`instrumentationMode` config key reserved for this)
