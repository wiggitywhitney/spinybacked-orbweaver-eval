# spinybacked-orbweaver-eval

Evaluation framework for [spiny-orb](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/spinybacked-orbweaver) — an AI agent that automatically instruments codebases with OpenTelemetry spans.

---

## What is spiny-orb?

spiny-orb reads a target codebase alongside an OpenTelemetry Weaver schema and uses an LLM to add OTel instrumentation (spans, attributes, error recording) to application source files. It creates a branch, opens a PR, and runs a checkpoint test suite after each file to catch instrumentation errors before they land.

This repo does not contain application code. The target app being evaluated (commit-story-v2) lives at [wiggitywhitney/commit-story-v2](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/commit-story-v2).

---

## Evaluation target: commit-story-v2

commit-story-v2 is the current JavaScript evaluation target. It is a Node.js CLI that generates journal entries from git commits using LangGraph (LangChain's graph orchestration framework), the Anthropic API, and an MCP server — giving spiny-orb a codebase with LLM calls, async I/O, graph-based orchestration, and auto-instrumentation library interactions to navigate.

Future evaluation targets are planned for TypeScript, Python, and Go. Candidate repos for each language are documented in [`docs/research/eval-target-criteria.md`](docs/research/eval-target-criteria.md).

## How evaluation works

Each evaluation run instruments commit-story-v2 with spiny-orb, then assesses the output against two scoring systems:

### Code-level rubric (31 rules)

The rubric evaluates the source code diff across six dimensions:

| Dimension | Prefix | Rules | What it checks |
|-----------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Non-Destructiveness | NDS | 6 | Agent preserved existing behavior; no business logic modified |
| Coverage | COV | 6 | Right functions got spans; auto-instrumentation correctly deferred |
| Restraint | RST | 5 | Agent didn't over-instrument utility functions, getters, or wrappers |
| API-Only Dependency | API | 3 | Only `@opentelemetry/api` imported — no SDK, no vendor packages |
| Schema Fidelity | SCH | 4 | Span names and attribute keys match the Weaver registry |
| Code Quality | CDQ | 8 | Spans closed in all paths, correct error recording, attribute data quality |

Five of the 31 rules are **gates** — if any gate fails, quality scoring is skipped. The remaining 26 rules produce a score out of 25 (COV and RST exclude two advisory-only rules from the count).

For full rule specifications, audit decisions, and OTel spec alignment, see [`docs/rules-reference.md`](https://github.com/wiggitywhitney/spinybacked-orbweaver/blob/main/docs/rules-reference.md) in the spiny-orb repo.

### Instrumentation Score (IS)

The [Instrumentation Score](https://github.com/instrumentation-score/spec) evaluates the runtime OTLP telemetry the instrumented app actually emits. It checks resource attributes, span topology, cardinality, and semantic convention placement. Run-14 established the first IS baseline: **80/100**.

## Run history: commit-story-v2

| Run | Quality | Gates | Files | Spans | Cost | Push/PR | IS |
|-----|---------|-------|-------|-------|------|---------|-----|

| 10 | 23/25 (92%) | 5/5 | 12 | 28 | $4.36 | NO | — |
| 11 | **25/25 (100%)** | 5/5 | 13 | 39 | $4.25 | YES | — |
| 12 | 23/25 (92%) | 5/5 | 12+1p | 31 | $5.19 | YES | — |
| 13 | **25/25 (100%)** | 5/5 | 7+1p+11f | 16 | ~$6.41 | YES | — |
| 14 | 22/25 (88%) | 5/5 | 12 | 32 | $5.59 | YES | **80/100** |

Files column notation: plain count = committed files; `+Np` = N partial files (instrumentation started, not fully committed); `+Nf` = N files rolled back after a checkpoint test failure. Cost column: `~` prefix indicates an estimated/derived cost (early runs predating direct cost reporting in the tool); unprefixed values are directly reported by spiny-orb.

**Run-15 is next** — verifying catch-block consistency in `journal-graph.js` (`summaryNode` error recording) and monitoring COV-004 disposition from the parallel advisory rules audit (spiny-orb PRD #483).

## Run history: release-it

release-it is the JavaScript evaluation target for testing spiny-orb on a foreign (non-primary) codebase. It is a release automation CLI for Node.js — no LangGraph, no LLM calls, no MCP server. The async I/O is primarily git operations, GitHub/GitLab REST API calls, and npm registry checks, giving spiny-orb a structurally different challenge than commit-story-v2.

| Run | Quality | Gates | Files | Spans | Cost | Push/PR | Q×F | IS |
|-----|---------|-------|-------|-------|------|---------|-----|-----|
| 1 | N/A (halted) | N/A | 0+5f | 0 | $0.68 | NO | 0 | — |
| 2 | 24/25 (96%) | 4/5† | 0+13f | 0 | $5.69 | branch YES / PR FAILED | 0 | N/E |
| 3 | 25/25 (100%) | 5/5 | 3 | 6 | $1.59 | push YES / manual PR | 3.0 | 90/100 |
| 4 | 24/25 (96%) | 5/5 | 7 | 20 | $6.97 | push YES / PR manual‡ | 6.7 | 100/100 |

Files column: `+Nf` = N files rolled back by checkpoint or end-of-run test failure. Run-1 halted at file 5/23. Run-2 processed all 23 files; 0 committed net due to OTel module resolution failures at every checkpoint.
† Gates: 4 pass + 1 NOT EVALUABLE (NDS-002 — checkpoint tests fail for infrastructure reasons, not agent error). NDS-003 gate fails for GitHub.js.
‡ Run-4: push succeeded to correct fork (RUN3-2 fixed). PR auto-creation failed with `spawn E2BIG` — PR body too large for `gh pr create --body` (compliance report is a 399K-line JSON blob). Manual PR #3 created.
IS column: N/E = Not Evaluable (no instrumented files survived to the working tree).

**Run-5 is next** — primary goal: resolve the indentation-width conflict (LINT/NDS-003) that caused all 6 run-4 failures. The `startActiveSpan` wrapper adds 2 indent levels, pushing long lines over Prettier's 120-char print width; the agent can't satisfy both LINT and NDS-003 simultaneously. Fix requires a Prettier post-pass before NDS-003 comparison, or computing NDS-003 baseline against the Prettier-formatted original. Secondary goal: fix PR auto-creation (`E2BIG` — use `gh pr create --body-file` instead of `--body`).

## Adding a new evaluation target

The complete process is in [`docs/language-extension-plan.md`](docs/language-extension-plan.md). The step most likely to cause silent failures:

**GitHub PAT setup** — spiny-orb needs a fine-grained PAT to push the instrument branch and open a PR. The PAT must be scoped to the fork (`wiggitywhitney/<target>`) with **Contents: Read and write** + **Pull requests: Read and write**. Store it as `GITHUB_TOKEN_<TARGET>` in GCP Secret Manager and add it to both `.vals.yaml` files. Before running, verify with:

```bash
vals exec -i -f .vals.yaml -- bash -c 'git push --dry-run https://x-access-token:$GITHUB_TOKEN_<TARGET>@github.com/wiggitywhitney/<target>.git HEAD:main'
```

This is the check that was missing across 8 consecutive push failures on commit-story-v2 (runs 3–10). "Password authentication is not supported" means the token is wrong — stop and regenerate. Full setup pattern in `~/.claude/rules/eval-github-pat.md`.

**Note for spiny-orb team**: this PAT setup pattern should be included in the TypeScript (and future language) setup guides so end users know how to configure GitHub push auth before running spiny-orb.
