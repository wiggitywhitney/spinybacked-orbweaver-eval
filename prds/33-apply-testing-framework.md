# PRD #33: Apply Testing Framework to commit-story-v2

## Problem Statement

commit-story-v2 has no tests, no CI pipeline, and no verification workflow. The project makes LLM calls via LangGraph, collects git and Claude Code data, and generates journal entries — all untested. Without tests, there is no safety net for autonomous development or even confidence that existing features still work after changes.

This PRD applies the shared testing framework from PRD #25 to commit-story-v2 specifically.

## Solution Overview

Wire up the shared config repo (from PRD #25), write tests for existing functionality, set up CI, and establish a project-specific testing strategy for LLM-dependent code.

Key decisions this PRD must make:
- How to test LLM-calling code (real calls vs mocks vs contract/snapshot tests)
- What coverage level is realistic for this project
- Which existing modules get tested first (highest risk / most breakage-prone)

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want tests that prove the git collector actually collects git data correctly
- As a developer, I want tests that prove the Claude collector parses chat history correctly
- As a developer, I want tests that verify the AI generation pipeline produces valid journal entries
- As a developer, I want a CI pipeline that catches regressions before code reaches main
- As a developer, I want to know my LLM-dependent code works without running expensive API calls on every test run

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test framework installed and configured (Vitest)
- [ ] Tests exist for non-LLM modules (collectors, context integration, journal manager, filtering)
- [ ] LLM testing strategy decided and implemented (at minimum: contract tests or snapshot tests for AI generation)
- [ ] `npm test` runs all tests and reports coverage
- [ ] CI pipeline runs tests on every PR via GitHub Actions
- [ ] Shared `/verify` skill from PRD #25 works in this repo
- [ ] CodeRabbit + CI + tests all gate PRs before merge

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Test Framework Setup
**Status**: Not Started

- [ ] Install Vitest as test framework
- [ ] Configure for ES modules (this project uses ESM)
- [ ] Add `npm test` and `npm run test:coverage` scripts
- [ ] Wire up shared `/verify` skill from PRD #25's config repo
- [ ] Write one smoke test to confirm the framework works

**Done when**: `npm test` runs and passes with at least one test.

---

### Milestone 2: Core Module Tests
**Status**: Not Started

Test the deterministic, non-LLM modules:

- [ ] **Git collector** (`src/collectors/git/`) — Test diff collection, commit message parsing, edge cases (empty commits, binary files, large diffs)
- [ ] **Claude collector** (`src/collectors/claude/`) — Test chat history parsing, filtering, session detection
- [ ] **Context integration** (`src/context/`) — Test merging of git and Claude data into unified context
- [ ] **Journal manager** (`src/journal/`) — Test file path generation, markdown writing, date handling, duplicate detection
- [ ] **Filtering** — Test relevance filtering, size limits, content selection

**Done when**: All non-LLM modules have tests that catch real failures. Coverage target: 80% for these modules.

---

### Milestone 3: LLM Testing Strategy
**Status**: Not Started

Decide and implement a strategy for testing the AI generation pipeline:

- [ ] **Research options** — Real API calls (expensive but accurate), recorded responses (snapshot/golden file tests), contract tests (verify input/output shapes), mock tests (verify orchestration logic)
- [ ] **Decide approach** — Document the decision and rationale
- [ ] **Implement** — Write tests using the chosen strategy
- [ ] **Document** — Add to project CLAUDE.md so future development follows the same pattern

**Done when**: AI generation pipeline has tests that provide meaningful confidence without excessive cost.

---

### Milestone 4: CI Pipeline
**Status**: Not Started

- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for PRs
- [ ] Run: build, lint (if applicable), tests with coverage
- [ ] Block merge on test failure
- [ ] Keep workflow fast (target: under 5 minutes)
- [ ] Integrate with existing CodeRabbit review workflow

Note: This absorbs PRD #23 (CI/CD Pipeline) scope for this repo.

**Done when**: PRs are gated by both automated tests and CodeRabbit review.

---

### Milestone 5: Integration Validation
**Status**: Not Started

- [ ] Run the full commit-story pipeline (git hook → collectors → context → AI → journal) and verify tests catch real failures
- [ ] Introduce a deliberate bug and confirm tests catch it
- [ ] Run `/verify` skill and confirm it produces a useful report
- [ ] Update project CLAUDE.md with testing rules specific to this repo

**Done when**: End-to-end confidence that the testing infrastructure catches real problems.

## Out of Scope

- MCP server testing — handle separately if needed
- Performance testing / benchmarking
- Testing against multiple AI providers (this project uses Anthropic only)

## Dependencies

- **PRD #25** (Testing & Autonomous Development Infrastructure) — Shared config repo must exist with `/verify` skill and CLAUDE.md templates
- PRD #23 (CI/CD Pipeline) — Absorbed into Milestone 4

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM tests are flaky due to non-determinism | High | Use contract/snapshot tests rather than exact output matching. Set temperature to 0 for test runs. |
| LLM test costs add up | Medium | Minimize real API calls. Use recorded responses for most tests, real calls only for smoke tests. |
| Testing existing code reveals bugs | Low (actually positive) | Fix bugs as found. This is a feature, not a risk. |
| ESM configuration issues with Vitest | Low | Vitest has good ESM support. Document any workarounds needed. |
