## Problem Statement

SpinybackedOrbWeaver — the new telemetry agent implementation built from spec v3.9 — has phases 1–6 complete (332 tests passing) and is approaching release readiness. The previous implementation (telemetry-agent-spec-v3) was evaluated in telemetry-agent-research PRDs #1–3 and scored 79% on the rubric but had catastrophic system-level failures: "332 unit tests pass, nothing works" — unwired CLI, broken validation chain, silent failures that wasted $5.50 across 7 failed runs.

SpinybackedOrbWeaver was built specifically to address those findings, but it has not yet been evaluated against real code. We need to run the same evaluation process to verify the new implementation actually works end-to-end and to measure improvement.

## Solution Overview

Run SpinybackedOrbWeaver against this repo's JavaScript codebase using the existing 31-rule evaluation rubric (at `spinybacked-orbweaver/research/evaluation-rubric.md`), score the output, and compare against the previous evaluation/run-1 baseline.

### Key Inputs (Already Exist)

- **Evaluation rubric**: 4 gate checks (NDS-001, NDS-002, NDS-003, API-001) + 27 quality rules across 6 dimensions (Non-Destructiveness, Coverage, Restraint, API Dependency, Schema Fidelity, Code Quality) + 19 Instrumentation Score rules. 28 of 30 code rules are fully automatable.
- **Codebase mapping**: `spinybacked-orbweaver/research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md` — maps every rubric rule to specific functions, call sites, and error-handling locations in commit-story-v2.
- **Weaver schema**: `telemetry/registry/` with custom attributes for the commit-story domain.
- **Baseline (evaluation/run-1)**: 4 files instrumented, 3 correctly skipped, 7 spans added. Previous report, patterns doc, and rubric scores at `telemetry-agent-research/evaluation/`.
- **Target codebase**: JavaScript (not TypeScript) — a critical finding from the last evaluation.

### Evaluation Interface

SpinybackedOrbWeaver has three interfaces: CLI (`orb init` / `orb instrument`), MCP server, and GitHub Action. The CLI is the primary evaluation interface.

## Success Criteria

1. SpinybackedOrbWeaver runs against commit-story-v2-eval without catastrophic failures
2. Full 31-rule rubric scored with per-rule evidence
3. Clear baseline comparison showing improvement (or regression) vs run-1
4. All findings filed as issues on spinybacked-orbweaver repo
5. Gap analysis documents any new rubric gaps or spec gaps discovered

## Milestones

- [x] **Pre-flight verification** — SpinybackedOrbWeaver builds and runs against this repo: Weaver schema validates, `orb init` succeeds, single-file dry-run confirms tool works end-to-end. Rubric codebase mapping verified against current source; any mapping drift documented.
- [x] **Evaluation run** — `orb instrument` executed against `src/` directory (21 files). 17/21 succeeded, 4 failed. All output captured in `evaluation/run-2/` (log, diffs, summary). Instrumented code on branch `orb/instrument-1773326732807`. Zero manual patches needed.
- [x] **Rubric scoring** — Full 31-rule rubric scored in `evaluation/run-2/rubric-scores.md`. Gates: 4/4 pass. Quality rules: 20/27 pass (74%), 2 partial, 5 fail. Strongest: Restraint 5/5 (100%), NDS 2/2 (100%). Weakest: API 0/3 (0% — mega-bundle + CJS in ESM + SDK in prod deps). Key failures: SCH-001 (span naming), CDQ-008 (tracer naming inconsistency), API-002/003/004 (all in instrumentation.js/package.json).
- [x] **Baseline comparison** — Full comparison in `evaluation/run-2/baseline-comparison.md`. System reliability: catastrophic → first-try success. Quality: 79% → 74% (not apples-to-apples: 4 TS files vs 21 JS files). Manual patches: 3 → 0. Attempts: 8 → 1. Improved: restraint (100%), schema fidelity (75%), language detection, zero patches. Regressed: API dependency model (0%), tracer naming inconsistency. Non-destructiveness and code quality maintained.
- [x] **Gap analysis and synthesis** — Full analysis in `evaluation/run-2/gap-analysis.md`. Found 5 bugs, 4 spec gaps, 3 rubric gaps. 9 issues filed on spinybacked-orbweaver (#61-#69) with fix instructions referencing run-2 evaluation artifacts. Bugs: mega-bundle (#61), CJS in ESM (#62), retry loop gap (#63), tracer naming (#64), span naming (#65). Spec gaps: module system detection (#66), SDK placement (#67), retry classification (#68), token budget strategy (#69). Rubric gaps: API-004 SDK setup carve-out, coverage partial scoring, module system correctness rule.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Phase 7 (git workflow/PR generation) not yet complete | Evaluation can run without it — capture output on a branch manually. If Phase 7 lands first, use the full PR workflow instead. |
| Codebase mapping is stale (functions changed since mapping was written) | Pre-flight milestone explicitly verifies mapping accuracy before running evaluation. |
| `orb instrument` fails on first attempt | Document failure mode, apply minimal patches (as done in run-1 where 3 patches were needed), and document what was patched and why. |
| Rubric doesn't cover new failure modes | Gap analysis milestone specifically looks for new rubric gaps to inform rubric evolution. |
| Cost exceeds budget | `orb instrument --dry-run` provides cost ceiling in pre-flight. Previous run was ~$5.50–6.50 across 8 attempts. |
| Datadog proxy intercepts Anthropic API calls | Unset `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` env vars when running `orb`. |
| `orb init` prerequisites (OTel API peer dep, SDK init file, schema path) | Documented setup steps: `npm install --save-peer @opentelemetry/api`, create `src/instrumentation.js`, symlink `semconv/` → `telemetry/registry/`. |

## Prior Art

- **telemetry-agent-research PRDs #1–3**: Previous evaluation cycle against the old implementation
- **evaluation/run-1 branch**: Previous instrumentation output preserved in this repo
- **telemetry-agent-research/evaluation/**: Report, patterns doc, and rubric scores from previous evaluation
- **spinybacked-orbweaver/research/evaluation-rubric.md**: The 31-rule rubric
- **spinybacked-orbweaver/research/rubric-codebase-mapping.md**: Rule-to-code mapping

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-03-07 | Use CLI interface for evaluation | CLI (`orb init` / `orb instrument`) is the primary interface; MCP and GitHub Action are secondary |
| 2026-03-07 | Manual branch creation for results | Phase 7 (git workflow) not yet complete; manual branching is sufficient for evaluation |
| 2026-03-12 | Skip full dry-run, proceed directly to instrumentation | Single-file dry-run (`src/utils/config.js`) confirmed tool works. Full dry-run cost ceiling (21 files, ~$39 max) was already shown. No value in dry-running all 21 files before the real run. |
| 2026-03-12 | Unset Datadog proxy env vars when running `orb` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` from Datadog shell integration route API calls through a proxy requiring a `source` header. Workaround: `env -u ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL -u ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_HEADERS` prefix. |
| 2026-03-12 | Symlink `semconv/` → `telemetry/registry/` for schema detection | `orb init` searches for `semconv/`, `schema/`, or `semantic-conventions/` in project root. This repo's schema lives at `telemetry/registry/`. Symlink is least invasive. |
| 2026-03-12 | Created `src/instrumentation.js` SDK bootstrap | `orb init` requires an OTel SDK init file with NodeSDK pattern. Created minimal file with empty `instrumentations` array for the agent to populate. |
| 2026-03-12 | Bug found: `orb instrument` swallows per-file error messages | `instrument-handler.ts` `onFileComplete` callback only prints "failed" without reason or error detail. Fixed locally in spinybacked-orbweaver — to be filed as an issue. |

## Notes

This is the validation gate before SpinybackedOrbWeaver can be considered release-ready. The evaluation is self-referential: commit-story's git hook runs on every commit, generating journal entries — after instrumentation, commits also produce telemetry data.
