## Partial Files (3)

| File | Spans | Attempts | Cost | Failure |
|------|-------|----------|------|---------|
| collectors/claude-collector.js | 1 | 3 | $0.56 | NDS-003: `allMessages.sort(...)` split at deeper indentation inside span callback — new PRD #875 pattern |
| managers/summary-manager.js | 6 | 2 | $1.81 | NDS-003: `generateAndSaveDailySummary` (return object literal), `generateAndSaveWeeklySummary` (`formatted,`), `generateAndSaveMonthlySummary` (`basePath`) — multi-line expressions reformatted at deeper indentation |
| managers/auto-summarize.js | 2 | 3 | $1.12 | NDS-003: `triggerAutoSummaries` — spread array expression `[...result.failed, ...]` reformatted at deeper indentation |

All three partial failures share the same root cause as claude-collector.js: lines near Prettier's 80-char boundary that fit at original indentation but are reformatted inside `startActiveSpan` callback. Same class targeted by PRD #875 (AST comparison). normalize-both-sides (PRD #845) did not resolve this class.

**Note**: summary-manager.js is a regression from run-18, where all 9 spans committed. In run-18, file-level instrumentation succeeded for generateAndSave*; in run-19, function-level fallback ran and those 3 functions failed NDS-003.

## P1 Finding Results (RUN18-1)

| File | Run-18 | Run-19 | Resolution |
|------|--------|--------|------------|
| generators/summary-graph.js | FAILED (NDS-003, 6 span wrappers) | ✅ SUCCESS (6 spans) | PRD #845 fixed this pattern |
| src/index.js | FAILED (NDS-003, multi-line imports) | ✅ SUCCESS (1 span) | PRD #845 fixed this pattern |
| mcp/tools/context-capture-tool.js | FAILED (NDS-003, server.tool callback) | ✅ SUCCESS (0 spans, sync wrapper) | Pre-scan correctly identified registerContextCaptureTool as synchronous — inner async callback not an exported function |
| mcp/tools/reflection-tool.js | FAILED (NDS-003, server.tool callback) | ✅ SUCCESS (0 spans, sync wrapper) | Same as context-capture-tool.js |

All 4 files that were blocked in run-18 now process without failure. context-capture-tool.js and reflection-tool.js commit 0 spans (correct per RST-001 — the only exported function is synchronous).

## Notable Observations

1. **RUN18-1 fully resolved** — All 4 previously-blocked files process without failure. summary-graph.js (6 spans, 1 attempt) is the clearest confirmation that PRD #845 normalize-both-sides fixed the complex nested-callback offset pattern. index.js (1 span, 1 attempt) also commits cleanly for the first time.

2. **context-capture-tool.js and reflection-tool.js now 0-span correct skips** — Previous runs were failing NDS-003 on attempts to instrument the async callback inside `server.tool()`. The pre-scan now correctly identifies `registerContextCaptureTool` and `registerReflectionTool` as synchronous exported functions — the inner async handler is not separately exported, so COV-001 doesn't apply. This is correct behavior per RST-001.

3. **New NDS-003 false-positive class: indentation-driven Prettier reformatting** — Three files (claude-collector.js, summary-manager.js, auto-summarize.js) hit NDS-003 on lines near Prettier's 80-char print width that reformat differently at the deeper indentation of a `startActiveSpan` callback body. This is the exact class PRD #875 (AST comparison) is designed to fix. normalize-both-sides (PRD #845) handles the case where a function is *not* instrumented (same indentation), but cannot handle the case where it *is* instrumented (indentation increases).

4. **summary-manager.js regression** — Dropped from 9 spans (run-18) to 6 spans (run-19). In run-18, file-level instrumentation succeeded for the 3 `generateAndSave*` orchestrators. In run-19, the function-level fallback ran instead and those 3 functions failed NDS-003 on multi-line expression reformatting. Net effect: the primary COV-001 entry points for daily/weekly/monthly generation are not instrumented.

5. **journal-graph.js: 3 consecutive successes** — Run-17 failure was confirmed a one-off. The 65% thinking budget cap is sufficient for this file.

6. **RUN18-2 persists (SCH-002 on journal-manager.js)** — `discoverReflections` uses `commit_story.journal.quotes_count` again, with the agent reasoning that "reflections being developer-written content" aligns with the schema description for quotes. The description says "AI-extracted journal quotes" — a different operation class. Explicit negative guidance or a new schema attribute is still required.

7. **Auto-push confirmed working** — Issue #867 retry fix confirmed. No "push again" intervention needed. This is the first fully-automatic push and PR in the series.

8. **Live-check: 523 spans** — Down from 575 in run-18, reflecting the 4-file partial set (generateAndSave* functions missing their spans).

9. **summary-detector.js: 9 spans** — Highest single-file span count in the run, instrumenting all 9 async filesystem-scanning functions across daily/weekly/monthly detection paths.
