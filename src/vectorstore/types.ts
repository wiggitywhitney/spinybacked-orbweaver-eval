/**
 * types.ts - Vector database interfaces and types
 *
 * What this file does:
 * Defines the interfaces that the rest of the system uses to interact with
 * the vector database. This is the abstraction layer — PRDs #25 and #26
 * import from here and never touch Chroma (or any other backend) directly.
 *
 * Why an abstraction layer?
 * The KubeCon demo shows both Chroma and Qdrant as vector database options.
 * By coding against interfaces, the data loading pipelines work with either
 * backend. Swap the implementation, keep the same pipeline code.
 *
 * Key concepts:
 * - VectorStore: The main interface for storing and searching documents
 * - EmbeddingFunction: Turns text into numbers (vectors) for similarity search
 * - VectorDocument: A document to store (text + metadata)
 * - SearchResult: A document found by similarity search (text + metadata + score)
 */

/**
 * A function that converts text into embedding vectors.
 *
 * What are embeddings?
 * When you embed text, you turn it into an array of numbers (a "vector") that
 * captures the meaning of the text. Similar texts produce similar vectors.
 * This is what makes semantic search possible — "find resources related to
 * databases" works because the query vector is close to vectors for database
 * resources, even if the exact words differ.
 *
 * Why an interface?
 * Different embedding models (Voyage AI, OpenAI, local models) all do the
 * same thing — text in, numbers out. The interface lets us swap models without
 * changing any vector store or pipeline code.
